 import express from 'express' cannot use import statement outside the module **error**
 because import statements are permitted only in ES modules. and node is not treating this 
 as es modules so we need to include this object in package.json {"type":module}.

javascript---------------------->
The json() method of the Response interface takes a HTTP Response stream and reads it to completion. It returns a promise which resolves with the result of parsing the body text as JSON.

/* height: 100px;
    height: 20vh; 
    overflow: unset; */
 
 /* view port height/width(vh/vw): This sets the size relative to the viewport(browser
    window) we can use it make a responsive div. but it effects only the 
    parent child elements will overflow.
    So I think we should use rem only for height and use media-querires to make 
    it responsive. */
    /*setting height equal to 100% will not work because we need 
    to set the height of its parent element height 100% i.e html 
    and body*/
    /* font-size : 100% means 16 px  it is relative to parent better to use rem in font-size
    (recommonded) and also better. */



  we cannot make a child of flex container  having display block.

  margin: auto can be done only for block elements remem
